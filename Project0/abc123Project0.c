	//2.  Use a loop to read the Employee information from Project0.txt and write the information to the entries of your array.  Suggestion:  read a single line of the file using fgets() then use sscanf() to parse out the variables from the line.  
	
	
	//3.  Loop through your array and print out the employee information.  Each employee (name, ID, hourly rate) should be on a single line.  The name should be left justified in a column of width 10.  The IDs are each 6 digits long so they can be printed with a single space after it.  The hourly rate should be printed to 2 decimal places.
